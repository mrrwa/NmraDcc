sentence=Enables NMRA DCC Communication 
paragraph=This library allows you to interface to a NMRA DCC track signal and receive DCC commands. The library has been tested on AVR ATTiny84/85 & ATMega88/168/328/32u4, ESP8266 and Teensy 3.x using the INT0/1 Hardware Interrupt and micros() ONLY and no longer uses Timer0 Compare Match B, which makes it much more portable to other platforms.
